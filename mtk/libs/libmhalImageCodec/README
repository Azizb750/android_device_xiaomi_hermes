Library of MTK JPEG Decode feature.

This library is pre-built by MediaTek internal.

WHAT IT DOES?
=============
libJpgDecPipe.so controls the MTK JPEG Decode flow and dispatch the decode tasks and parameters
to either SW or HW encoder to do the JPEG Decode tasks. This library also controls MTK HW resizing, 
rotating and Image quality tuning functions for Image postprocessing.

HOW IT WAS BUILT?
==================
It needs the following library from AOSP:
1.  liblog.so
2.  libutils.so
3.  libcutils.so
4.  libion.so

and the following libs from MediaTek:
1.  libion_mtk.so
2.  libm4u.so
3.  libSwJpgCodec.so
4.  libGdmaScalerPipe.so

All source/dependency modules of this module are already put in
'vendor/mediatek/libs' folder.

HOW TO USE IT?
==============
Provide api for JPEG Decode feature called from libmHalImageCodec.so.
all api interfaces are at (vendor\mediatek\proprietary\platform\mt6735\hardware\jpeg\inc)

All the source code of this library were written by MediaTek co..
