camera wrapper
==============
What is this?

Nougat use Clang 3.8 by default. Blobs built with gcc 4.9 clang 3.6 might
have address alignment issue. The first victim is libcam.halsenor from
Vibeui 3.5 dev. 1631. It crashed when calling the function getResolution()
This function's argument is a pointer to a sturct. That struct is an array
of pointers to another stuct. Mediatek's source use to assign a pointer to
the address of a local struct variable directly.
The only way is to avoid accessing that argument. That local struct is
inside the class ImgSensorDrv. We can't access the struct outside the class.
Fortunately ImgSensorDrv is self contained. This wrapper will create our own
ImgSensorDrv class. It will take over the ImgSensorDrv class inside the blob
libcam.halsensor.

The source was derived from the camera hal source for mt6735 and mt6595.
